# Comparing the Visualization Ability of CNN and CMILR
Combines the data retrieval method of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multiple-instance Logistic Regression (MILR) model to perform image recognition. This model is hereafter referred to as convolutional multiple-instance logistic regression (CMILR). By combining these patterns, CMILR has the high accuracy of a CNN and the predictability of a linear model with MILR. After simulations, we found that CMILR can accurately identify the shape of patterns and correctly predict their locations, and has a higher accuracy than CNNã€‚ There include Heatmap of being a positive instance (HIP) in CMILR and Heatmap with Grad-CAM (HGC) in CNN.
